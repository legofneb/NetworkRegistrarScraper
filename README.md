A Scraper for Network Registrar
===============================

This scrapes network registrar and generates a .csv file containing the IPAddress, Hostname, MAC Address, and status flags.
Much more useful in this report as the website, and much easier to use programmatically. 

You will need a config.ini file in this form:

    [User]
    id : your_network_registrar_id
    password: your_network_registrar_password

    [Website]
    rootUrl: https://network_registrar_path.yourCompany.com:port
